## 📊 Viewing Reports

### 📷 Sample Screenshots

Visual evidence from test execution and reporting tools.    

**Examples:**  
- ✅ Allure Dashboard with summary metrics  
- ✅ Test details with attached screenshots  

![Allure Dashboard](docs/screenshots/allure-dashboard.jpg)  
*Allure dashboard showing test pass rate and execution timeline.*  

![Test Detail](docs/screenshots/test-detail.jpg)  
*Detailed test case execution with step-by-step logs and attached screenshot.*  

### 🔹 Allure Report
To generate and open an interactive HTML report with screenshots:
```bash
allure serve <build/allure-results> # Write the directory path
```
This opens a browser window showing:
- Step-by-step test execution  
- Screenshots captured during the test  
- Descriptions and assertions  

---

### 🔹 Standard Gradle Reports
After running tests, you can also open the plain Gradle test report:  
```
build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```
Provides a summary of test cases, pass/fail counts, and execution times.
